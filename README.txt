Welcome to the BRICKS project

This project contains a set of PCBs that can be used for fast hardware and firmware prototyping. It contains a processor board and a number of peripheral boards. All boards can be stacked to establish a prototype PCB for the target device configuration.

At the moment the project supports STM32F103Cx microcontroller and a set of peripheral boards including:
1. ST1S10 based power supply board
2. SIM900 based GSM module board
3. AT25DFxxx based Flash memory board
4. MPC2551 based CAN transmitter board
5. 6x 1-digit LED based indicator board
6. LIS331DH based accelerometer board
7. input board
8. output board
9. USB board
10. Ethernet board
11. GPS module board
