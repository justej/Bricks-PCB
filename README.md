Welcome to the BRICKS project.

This project contains a set of PCBs that can be used for fast hardware and firmware prototyping. It contains a processor board and a number of peripheral boards. All boards can be stacked to establish a prototype PCB for the target device configuration.

At the moment the project supports STM32F103Cx microcontroller and a set of peripheral boards including:
* ST1S10 based power supply board
* SIM900 based GSM module board
* AT25DFxxx based Flash memory board
* MPC2551 based CAN transmitter board
* 6x 1-digit LED based indicator board
* LIS331DH, LSM303D, LIS2DM and L3GD20 based orientation board
* input board
* USB board
* GPS module board
